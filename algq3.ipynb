    "An imaginary university is interested in accepting some of the applicants for positions to study the Master of Data Science there. Unfortunately, only a few spots are available, so the university requires students to take some exams. Students are then admitted based on how well they perform on these exams. For students to determine whether they have been successfully accepted to the university, the university wants to create a ranking list that includes every student's first name, last name, and total average on its course webpage. Students should be ranked in the list based on their average points in descending order. For example, if two students have the same average punctuation, they should be sorted in ascending order using their first and last names. University will give you the students' information in 'ApplicantsInfo.txt', and you should provide them with the ranking list in another .txt file and name it as 'RankingList.txt' . Kindly help this university in preparing this ranking list."

    "On average, the bubble sort performs poorly compared to the insertion sort. Due to the high number of swaps, it’s expected to generate twice as many write operations and twice as many cache misses. Both have similar runtime complexities. However, for larger datasets, the bubble sort algorithm becomes slower.\n",
    "Selection sort generally performs worse than insertion sort.\n",
    "It doesn’t adapt to data and always performs a quadratic number of comparisons.\n",
    "However, it moves each element at most once.The main difference between insertion sort and selection sort is that insertion sort performs sorting by exchanging an element at a time with the partially sorted array while selection sort performs sorting by selecting the smallest element from the remaining elements and exchanging it with the element in the correct location.\n",
    "All in all, insertion sort performs better in most cases. Consequently, it is more popular in textbooks and in real life."
